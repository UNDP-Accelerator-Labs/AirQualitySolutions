The Pay-As-You-Go (PAYG) approach to solar energy removes the upfront price barrier by allowing end users to pay in affordable amounts over time. A company essentially rents consumers a solar home system. Basic systems have enough power to charge phones and lights, and larger ones can power small appliances like radios or TVs. PAYG schemes use smart meters installed in households to monitor energy use and enable consumers to pay in smaller increments on a daily, weekly, or monthly basis using mobile banking platforms. Through this model,  access to energy in off-grid areas is improved, companies can minimize the cost of collections by automating the receipt of payments and remote rural customers get immediate access to basic electricity without having to take out a loan.","Improved public health, increased access to affordable elecricity",FALSE,FALSE,Mitigation measure,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,NA,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,FALSE,TRUE,FALSE,"Pay-As-You-Go can also be applied to other renewable energy sources such as biomass.

A heat pump uses technology similar to that found in an air conditioner. It extracts heat from a source, such as the surrounding air, geothermal energy stored in the ground, or nearby sources of water or waste heat from a factory. Because most of the heat is transferred rather than generated, heat pumps are far more efficient than conventional heating technologies such as boilers or electric heaters. Households with a heat pump also spend less on energy than those using a gas boiler.

The Center for Active Transportation (TCAT) uses an innovative, evidence-based approach to incubating cycling in suburban communities through community bike hubs. Community bike hubs are spaces where people can learn more about cycling, meet other people who cycle, and go cycling together. They offer bike loans, bike mentorships, earn-your-bike programs, and guided rides, to encourage people to adopt cycling in areas where few people cycle. By addressing significant barriers in suburbs outside of infrastructure, the approach can accelerate cycling adoption and grow a cycling community. TCAT‚Äôs community bike hub approach is based on a four-step approach that other suburban communities can replicate: 1) find the neighborhood, 2) identify local barriers, 3) remove barriers and start cycling, and 4) keep cycling.

109,Urban Heat Island Mitigation Strategies (combining various approaches),"Infrastructure Development, Urban Planning &amp; Design",Construction,"Urban Heat Island (UHI) mitigation strategies encompass a variety of approaches to reduce heat absorption and promote cooling effects in urban areas. Here are some key strategies:
-Increasing Vegetation and Green Space: Trees, shrubs, and other vegetation provide shade, absorb heat, and release cooling moisture through transpiration. This can involve planting trees along streets, creating green roofs, and establishing urban parks.
-Using Cool Materials for Roofs and Pavements: Replacing traditional dark roofs and pavements with lighter, reflective materials reduces heat absorption and lowers surface temperatures. This can involve using reflective coatings or installing green roofs.
-Promoting Smart Growth Practices: Urban planning that incorporates green infrastructure, encourages compact development, and minimizes heat-trapping concrete expanses can significantly reduce the urban heat island effect.
-Urban Water Features: Fountains, water streams, and strategically placed ponds can provide evaporative cooling and create a more comfortable microclimate.","Reduced energy consumption for cooling buildings

The effectiveness of UHI mitigation strategies depends on a combination of approaches tailored to the specific climate, geography, and existing infrastructure of a city. A comprehensive strategy that considers vegetation, cool materials, smart growth, and water features can significantly reduce the urban heat island effect and create more livable urban environments.
Urban Heat Island mitigation strategies can have a complex relationship with air quality, with both potential benefits and drawbacks. They can help reduce ozone formation and particulate matter concentrations but may require careful planning to avoid unintended consequences.
