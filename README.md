# Solutions to air pollution

## Data description
The [UNDP Accelerator Lab in North Macedonia](https://www.undp.org/acceleratorlabs/undp-north-macedonia-accelerator-lab) has compiled a collection of roughly 135 desk notes (referred to here as “the dataset”) on air quality solutions from around the world. These range from policy measures, to infrastructure design and architecture, to technological solutions. Each note includes a short description of the solution, some high-level geographic information, a link to the solution’s official webpage or mention in the media, and (in most cases) one or more images that illustrate the solution. These are shared here as cards to facilitate workshop activities.

Note this is a collection of notes shared primarily for inspiration. The solutions showcased here are not endorsed in any way by the UNDP Accelerator Labs, or by UNDP.

## Short thematic background
Air pollution is a critical global issue that profoundly affects human health and overall ecosystems. With the rapid expansion of urbanization and industrialization, the emission of harmful pollutants into the atmosphere has escalated to concerning levels, leading to widespread diseases, including respiratory diseases, environmental degradation, and intensification of climate change. Undertaking immediate actions for tackling the air pollution is essential to creating healthier, more sustainable environment.

## Context
The UNDP North Macedonia's "Scaling-up Actions to Tackle Air Pollution Project" is dedicated to supporting local authorities in five pilot municipalities across North Macedonia. The project focuses on detecting and measuring pollution sources, identifying and planning effective mitigation strategies, and implementing these measures. Additionally, it aims to raise public awareness and encourage behavioral change as part of a comprehensive prevention approach.

In response to this pressing challenge, we have curated a comprehensive dataset showcasing innovative air protection solutions from around the globe. Through this initiative—mapping air protection solutions implemented worldwide—we aim to provide access to a broad array of effective actions, measures, or strategies at both local and national levels, highlighting exemplary cases in the fight against air pollution.
